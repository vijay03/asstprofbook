The book chapters will always be available for free online at [this website](https://vijay03.github.io/asstprofbook/chapters-list/).

The book is also available for purchase (via Amazon) in various forms: <br>

- [Paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCCQR3T2)
- [Hardcover](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCCX6LRC)

The book is available in a number of other countries/regions, such as [India](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPLYLKQK), [Europe](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0BPLYLKQK), [Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0BPLYLKQK), and [Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0BPLYLKQK).

I'm still exploring making it available from other vendors (it is not exclusive to Amazon).
