Hello! My name is Vijay Chidambaram, and I'm an Assistant Professor (Associate Professor from Fall 22) at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm planning to write "The CS Assistant Professor" Handbook over the next year or so while I'm on my sabbatical (hope to be done by Jun 23!).

## Why write this book?

First, I wanted to document my own journey of becoming a professor and getting tenure. I was inspired by [similar posts](https://arunis100.medium.com/the-secret-lives-of-millennial-cs-assistant-professors-part-1-41dc712375ca) from [Arun Kumar](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/) at UC San Diego. Second, I feel like this knowledge (of how to do the job as an assistant professor in computer science) is handed down from professor to their students, but is not organized and documented in one place. Third, this is advice I anticipate giving my own students and postdocs down the years. So following [Matt Might's advice](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/), I'm writing it all down. 

## Who is this book for?

This book is mainly meant for new assistant professors, and graduate students who are going to start as assistant professors in the near future. That being said, I think it will be helpful to undergraduate or graduate students who want to pursue this path, since it shows them what the job is like. 

## Outline (as of Jun 2022)

## How can I access this content? 

Being a student of [Remzi](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi) and [Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau), how could I not make this [a free online book](http://from-a-to-remzi.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-case-for-free-online-books-fobs.html)? The book chapters will always be available online at this website.

I plan to upload the chapter PDFs as I write them (without any fancy typography) onto this website. I will be creating a nicer-to-look-at print and e-reader version as well, that you could get from popular vendors such as Amazon. 

## Reporting errors 

If you see an error in the book, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/vijay03/asstprofbook/issues). Note that the actual text of the book isn't on Github, so you cannot submit pull requests. I would be happy to fix errors in response to issues.
