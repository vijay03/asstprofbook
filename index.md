Hello! My name is Vijay Chidambaram, and I'm an Assistant Professor (Associate Professor from Fall 22) at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm planning to write "The CS Assistant Professor" Handbook over the next year or so while I'm on my sabbatical (hope to be done by Jun 23!).

## Why write this book?

First, I wanted to document my own journey of becoming a professor and getting tenure. I was inspired by [similar posts](https://arunis100.medium.com/the-secret-lives-of-millennial-cs-assistant-professors-part-1-41dc712375ca) from [Arun](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~arunkk/) at UC San Diego. Second, I feel like this knowledge (of how to do the job as an assistant professor in computer science) is handed down from professor to their students, but is not organized and documented in one place. Third, this is advice I anticipate giving my own students and postdocs down the years. So following [Matt Might's advice](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/), I'm writing it all down.
