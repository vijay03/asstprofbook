title: Book Chapters
---

As I write the book, I will be uploading chapters here one by one. I will likely not write the book sequentially, and will instead opportunistically add chapters whenever I can. 

I'm aware the PDFs look terrible right now. Content first! My plan is to write it up, and then spend some time later making it look better.

Please point out errors by creating an [issue here](https://github.com/vijay03/asstprofbook/issues).
